                            On the east side of Rizal Park, this museum has paintings and sculptures by the most prominent Filipino artists in the 19th and 20th centuries.
                            Among them are Juan Luna, Fernando ZÃ³bel and FÃ©lix Hidalgo, who represented a wave of Filipino art that swelled as the country was pushing for independence from Spain.

                            That is the context for the museumss showpiece, the Spoliarium by Juan Luna.
                            This painting from 1884 won the gold medal at the ExposiciÃ³n Nacional de Bellas Artes in Madrid, and its symbolism, showing dead gladiators being dragged away from the circus, was not lost on JosÃ© Rizal.
